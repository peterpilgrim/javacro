Scala and Java EE 7 Development Experiences
---------------------------------------------

Scala is an alternative JVM language with both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms.
Scala development with the Java EE 7 platform is definitely possible and can be a pleasant experience.
If you have uncertainty about how Scala can fit around the Java EE 7 platform, then this session aims to illustrate
the huge benefit that Scala adoption can bring to the platform...
